## Sinkmoji: https://stinkmoji.cool/
This webpage provides a clean way of reading a webpage, which is similar to evernote, easyreader, etc. In addition to this function, Outline can be used to bypass the subscription requirement for some newspaper webpages. A more practical way to do this is to add 'outline.com' before the url, e.g., 'http://outline.com/realurl'.
